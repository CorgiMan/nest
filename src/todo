# DONE

- index.js
- main.rs
- job.rs
- genetic_algorithm.rs

# TODO

- packing.rs - pack
- nesting_runner.rs - setup initial state
- nest_polygon.rs - NFP + some basic geo calculations
- nfp_cache.rs

# Nesting runner setup

- pass sheet size
- pass parts, run and calc some geometrical properties (isConvex, area, etc)
- create rotations that fit
- error when part doesn't fit
- collect results
- async start, stop, status

# PackingSequence.pack

- NFP
- place parts one by one, using union

# NFPCache

- get NFP or calculate one
- use angle between and swap part symmetry to avoid work

# Tests

- geometric_algorithm
- packing
- nest_polygon
- nesting_manager

# Production readyness

- contextual logging (i.e. add ulid to logs, maybe tracing as well?)
- timeout
- check unwrap and unsafe usages
